# Infra2App Automation
 
This implementation automates infrastructure provisioning and application deployment using common DevOps tools.  
The process ensures a consistent and maintainable system through the following stages:  
* Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform provisions AWS Free Tier infrastructure components.
* Configuration Management: Ansible handles remote application deployment after provisioning.
* Containerization: [Docker containers](https://github.com/LamSut/ContainYourself) enable consistent deployment across different platforms.
* Security Hardening: Secure protocols and headers protect against common web threats.
* Blue-Green Deployment: Parallel environments enable updates with minimal downtime.
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions automates build, test and deployment workflows.
